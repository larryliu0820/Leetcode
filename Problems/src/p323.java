 * 323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph
 * Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function
 * to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

 Example 1:
 0          3
 |          |
 1 --- 2    4
 Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]], return 2.

 Example 2:
 0           4
 |           |
 1 --- 2 --- 3
 Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]], return 1.

 Note:
 You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0]
 and thus will not appear together in edges.
